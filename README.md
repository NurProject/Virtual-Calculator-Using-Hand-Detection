Mini Project - Virtual Calculator Using Hand Detection
I upgraded my mini virtual calculator project to this  thand detection virtual calculator.
The output of this project:  You can use your finger movement while using the calculator.
This project ‘Virtual-Calculator-Using-Hand-Detection’ helps us to perform few of the basic functionalities of a calculator easily using our finger detection.
In this project we will learn to create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply or divide depending upon the input from the user finger.
